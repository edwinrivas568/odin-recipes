    <h1>PIZZA</h1>
    <img src="../img/pizza.jpeg">

    <p>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups warm water, 600 mL</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>7 cups all-purpose flour(875 g), plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground mace</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound lean pork, cubed</li>
        <li>3/4 pound lean beef, cubed</li>
        <li>1/4 pound pork fat, cubed</li>
        
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, puree the onion, garlic, coriander, paprika, mustard seed, marjoram, and mace. Add the milk, egg white, sugar, salt, and pepper and combine well. Remove to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>One at a time, grind the pork, beef, and fat cubes through the fine blade of a meat grinder. Combine the 3 ingredients and grind them together.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the pureed seasonings with the meat and mix with your hands. Wet your hands with cold water to prevent the mixture from sticking.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes and then grind it again. Prepare the casings.</li>
